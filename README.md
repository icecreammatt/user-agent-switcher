# user-agent-rewriter

## What it does

Allows for setting custom user agents from a preselected list.  

It adds a browser action. The browser action has a popup that lets the user choose one of three browsers: Firefox 41, Chrome 41, and IE 11, Edge. When the user chooses a browser, the extension then rewrites the User Agent header so the real browser identifies itself as the chosen browser on the current tab.
