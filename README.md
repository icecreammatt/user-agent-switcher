## What it does

Allows for setting custom user agents from a preselected list.  

It adds a browser action. The browser action has a popup that lets the user choose one of these browsers: Edge, Firefox 111, Chrome 112, and IE 11. When the user chooses a browser, the extension then rewrites the User Agent header so the real browser identifies itself as the chosen browser on the current tab.
